This small project has been divided into several user stories, of which, a feature has
corresponding level of effort/estimate base on fibonacci numbers (same approach to www.scrumpoker-online.org)

• Registration			----> 1 point
	- Select Avatar		
• Login					----> 1 point
	- Logout			
• Store					----> 13 points
	- To buy dice, boards, costumes for player Avatar etc
• Leaderboard			---->  3 points
	- Show stats

There are other behind the scene time estimate namely

* Change Identity and Database from SQL to MongoDb	-----> 3 points
* CRUD & Services									-----> 3 points
* API												-----> 5 point

Each point equates to:
1 -	1 to 4 hours	(less than a day)
3 - 4 to 12 hours	(more or less a day)
5 - 20 to 30 hours	(few days, less than a week)
8 - 40 to 50 hours	(at least 1 week)
13 - 60 to 80 hours (2 weeks)

In this regard, I have spend only a portion of couple of hours, 
as I only have 8 to 12 hours during weekend.
I may not finished the entire feature as can be seen on estimate, 
but at least the ground work has been done.
